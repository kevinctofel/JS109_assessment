## Flow Control in JavaScript
How a program branches off to do different things based on inputs, outputs, etc...

### Conditionals
Checking "if" something is or happens changes the path or flow of code.

Simplest method is with ```if``` statements, which can also be followed by ```else``` conditions.

```js
if (x === 3) {                  // If statement
  console.log("x is 3");        // Clause to run
}
```
Note in above example, the curly braces for the code block aren't needed. A single statement or expression doesn't require them but it's good practice.
