## Constants in JavaScript

```const``` keyword is similar to ```let``` but is used to store data or values that don't change.

Constants are immutable so you can't assign new values to a declared constant.

Named constants are typically designated in all uppercase letters. You must assign a value when declaring a constant; which you don't have to do for a let statement.
