## Variables in JavaScript

Named area in memory to store data.
Should be descriptive so someone reading code will know exactly what the function does.

Part of the broader term called identifiers:
- Variable names declared by let and var
- Constant names declared by const
- Property names of objects
- Function names
- Function parameters
- Class names
