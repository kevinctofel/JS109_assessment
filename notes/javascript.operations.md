## Operations in JavaScript

### Operations on primitive data types

* Addition uses the + operator
* Subtraction uses the - operator
* Multiplication uses the * operator
* Division uses the / operator (for both integers and decimals)
* Division remainder (not modulo) uses the % operator

Key math difference between remainder and modulo:
* Remainder returns a positive integer when first operand is positive and a ngative integer when first operand is negative.
* Modulo retuns a positive integer when second operand is positive and a negative integer when second operand is negative.

This generally only affects JavaScript when either operand is a negative number.
