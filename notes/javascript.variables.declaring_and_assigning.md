Variable declarations reserve memory space with a specific name, typically using 'let' (also 'var' but that's older and is slightly different because it supports hosting, i.e.: variables called in code before they're declared.)

Initializing a variable can be done at the same time it is declared.

Declarations always return 'undefined'

When declaring a variable, the '=' is not an operator but is a syntactic token.
When assigning a value to a variable, the '=' is called the assignment operator.
