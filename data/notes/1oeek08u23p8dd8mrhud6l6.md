## Statements in JavaScript

Unlike expressions, you can't capture a value from a statements; they can't be used later in code like the value in an expression.

Example:
```js
> let foo = 3;
```
This is a declaration statement for the variable foo. The value of three, however, is an expression.

According to MDN: 'a statement is a line of code commanding a task. Every program consists of a sequence of statements.'
