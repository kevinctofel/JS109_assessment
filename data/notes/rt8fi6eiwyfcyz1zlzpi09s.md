## Null in JavaScript

Null is similar to, but different from, undefined. It signifies the intentional absense of a value. It sometimes represents emptiness of nothing.

Null must be used explicity, while undefinded can be used implicitly.

Example of a variable without a value but is still defined to have a value:
```js
> let foo = null
```
In this case, the literal value is null.
