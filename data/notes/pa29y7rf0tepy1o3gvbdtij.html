<h1 id="declaring-and-assigning-variables">Declaring and assigning variables<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#declaring-and-assigning-variables"></a></h1>
<p>Variable declarations reserve memory space with a specific name, typically using 'let' (also 'var' but that's older and is slightly different because it supports hosting, i.e.: variables called in code before they're declared.)</p>
<p>Initializing a variable can be done at the same time it is declared.</p>
<p>Declarations always return 'undefined'</p>
<p>When declaring a variable, the '=' is not an operator but is a syntactic token.
When assigning a value to a variable, the '=' is called the assignment operator. </p>
